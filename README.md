it's intended to hook the Nest camera's microphone and speakers in some meaningful way. Right now it just plays Wii Shop music
on endless loop.

how to wii shop music
1) download and install google chrome canary
2) `git clone --branch wii-shop-music git@github.com:Zemnmez/birdbox.git`
3) `yarn`
4) `yarn testrun`
5) if everything is in order in the console (will ask if it needs anything in console)
wii shop music will be playing on the first camera in the camera list.
